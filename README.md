# point-spread-function
Fit a gaussian to the intensity data of a fluorophore to determine the point spread function from an image
This is a simple script ot fit a gaussian to an intensity profile of any fluorophore. The code works by inputting an image (in .tiff format), and the unser then draws a line across the fluorophore or region of interest. The code then fits a gaussian to the function, and outputs the FWHM.
